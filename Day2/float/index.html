        <h1>About Watch: </h1>
        <p id="top">
            A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement
        despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by
        a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps, or any other kind of bracelet. A pocket
        watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain.</p>
        <p id="bottom">Watches appeared in the 16th century. During most of its history, the watch was a mechanical device, driven by
        clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. These are called
        mechanical watches.[1][2] In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept
        time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the
        mechanical watch. Historically, this is called the quartz revolution (also known as the quartz crisis in
        Switzerland).[3][4] Developments in the 2010s include smart watches, which are elaborate computer-like electronic
        devices designed to be worn on a wrist. They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are only a small
        subset of the smartwatch's facilities.</p>
