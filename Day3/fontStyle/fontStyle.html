    <h1>Ecommerce</h1>
    <h3>What is Ecommerce?</h3>
    <p class="content">Ecommerce (or electronic commerce) is the buying and selling of goods or services on the Internet. It encompasses a wide
    variety of data, systems and tools for online buyers and sellers, including mobile shopping and online payment
    encryption. 
    <br>
    Most businesses with an online presence use an online store and/or platform to conduct ecommerce marketing and sales
    activities and to oversee logistics and fulfillment.
    <br>
    According to eMarketer, in 2022, global retail ecommerce sales will surpass $5 trillion for the first time, accounting
    for more than a fifth of overall retail sales. And by 2025, total spending will exceed $7 trillion, despite slowing
    growth.</p>

    </h3>
    <p class="content">
        Ecommerce has come a long way since the CompuServe launch in 1969. Driven by changes in technology and global circumstances, ecommerce is growing and shows no sign of stopping. Sales in online stores are expected to reach 22% of global retail sales by 2023, compared to 14.1% in 2019. It is estimated that by 2024, digital wallets will account for over half of total ecommerce payment volumes. Amazon will account for 39.5% of all US retail ecommerce sales in 2022, or nearly $2 in $5 spent online.
