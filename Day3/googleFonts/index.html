        <h3>What is Ecommerce?</h3>
        <p class="content">Ecommerce (or electronic commerce) is the buying and selling of goods or services on the
            Communication is commonly defined as the transmission of information. Its precise definition is disputed and there are
            disagreements about whether unintentional or failed transmissions are included and whether communication not only
            transmits meaning but also creates it. Models of communication are simplified overviews of its main components and their
            interactions. Many models include the idea that a source uses a coding system to express information in the form of a
            message. The message is sent through a channel to a receiver who has to decode it to understand it. The main field of
            inquiry investigating communication is called communication studies.

            Verbal
        </h3>
        <p class="content">
            Verbal communication is the exchange of messages in linguistic form, i.e., by means of language. In colloquial
            usage, verbal communication is sometimes restricted to oral communication and may exclude writing and sign language.

        <h3>
            Non-verbal
        </h3>
        <p class="content">
            Non-verbal communication is the exchange of information through non-linguistic modes, like facial expressions, gestures,
            and postures. However, not every form of non-verbal behavior constitutes non-verbal communication.
