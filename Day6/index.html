                Revealing new details of the <span>hit-and-run accident in which a woman was killed in Mumbai</span> on
                Sunday
                morning, police told
                the court on Monday that the accused, Mihir Shah, who is alleged to have been driving the vehicle, switched
                seats
                with
                his driver “after dragging the woman on the bonnet for nearly one-and-a-half kilometres”. The driver,
                Rajrishi
                Rajendrasingh Bidawat, then “reversed the vehicle and mowed (down the woman) for the second time before
                escaping,”
                the
                police said, adding that this was done to “mislead” the investigation.

                Mihir, 24, is absconding, while his father, Shinde Sena leader Rajesh Shah, and Bidawat have been arrested.
                Rajesh
                Shah
                and Bidawat were produced before the metropolitan magistrate court in Sewri on Monday. While Bidawat was
                sent to
                police
                custody for a day, Shah was sent to judicial custody and later granted bail.

                On Sunday morning, Kaveri Nakhwa (45) was killed when a speeding BMW car, allegedly driven by Mihir, hit the
                two-wheeler
                on which she was travelling with her husband, Pradeep Nakhwa (50).
