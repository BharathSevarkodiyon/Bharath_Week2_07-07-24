        <h1>Plastic Bottle</h1>
        <p class="phase1">
            A plastic bottle is a <span class="blue">bottle</span> constructed from high-density or low density <span class="blue">plastic</span>. Plastic bottles are typically used to
            store liquids such as water, soft drinks, motor oil, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, milk, ink, etc. They come in a
            range of sizes, from very small bottles to large <span class="blue">carboys</span>. Consumer blow molded containers often have integral <span class="blue">handles</span> or
            are shaped to facilitate grasping.
        </p>
        <h2>Production</h2>
        <h4>Petrochemical resins</h4>
        <p class="phase2">
            <span>High-density polyethylene (HDPE)</span>
            HDPE is the most widely used resin for plastic bottles. This material is economical, impact resistant, and provides a
            good moisture barrier. HDPE is compatible with a wide range of products including acids and caustics but is not
            compatible with <span class="blue">solvents</span>. It is supplied in FDA-approved food grade. HDPE is naturally translucent and flexible. The
            addition of color will make HDPE opaque, but not glossy. HDPE lends itself to silk screen decoration. While HDPE
            provides good protection at below freezing temperatures, it cannot be used with products filled above 190 째F (88 째C) or
            products requiring a hermetic (vacuum) seal.
        </p>
        <p class="phase3">
            These bottles are exposed to fluorine gas in a secondary operation, are similar in appearance to HDPE, and serve as a
            barrier to hydrocarbons and aromatic solvents. Fluorine-treated bottles may contain insecticides, pesticides,
            herbicides, photographic chemicals, agricultural chemicals, household and industrial cleaners, electronic chemicals,
            medical cleaners and solvents, citrus products, d-limonene, flavors, fragrances, essential oils, surfactants, polishes,
            additives, graffiti cleaning products, pre-emergents, stone and tile care products, waxes, paint thinner, gasoline,
            biodiesel, xylene, acetone, kerosene and more.
        </p>
        <p class="phase4">
            <span>Low-density polyethylene (LDPE)</span>
            LDPE is similar in composition to HDPE. It is less rigid and generally less chemically resistant than HDPE, but is more
            translucent. LDPE is used primarily for squeeze applications. LDPE is significantly more expensive than HDPE.
        </p>
        <p class="phase5">
            <span>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET, PETE) / Polyester</span>
        This resin is commonly used for carbonated beverages, water bottles, and food packaging. PET provides very good alcohol
        and essential oil barrier properties, generally good chemical resistance (although acetones and ketones will attack
        PET), and a high degree of impact resistance and tensile strength. The orienting process serves to improve gas and
        moisture barrier properties and impact strength. This material is not resistant at high temperature. Its maximum
        temperature is 200 째F (93 째C).</p>

            Plastic bottles are marked at their base with the resin identification code to indicate the material used.
